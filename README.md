# Data_Analysis_Projects

These are just some of the Data Analysis projects I have done in SQL and Python. A lot of the work I have done in these projects is to manipulate the data to make it more readable, run queries to display relevent data that can help make conclusions from the data, and visualize the data. Most of these projects come from dataquest data scientist bootcamp.
